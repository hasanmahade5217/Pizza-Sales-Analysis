# Pizza-Sales-Analysis

This project involves analyzing a year's worth of sales data from an imaginary pizza shop. The dataset is collected from https://www.mavenanalytics.io/. The data includes details like the date, time, and specifics about each order, such as the type, size, quantity, price, and ingredients of the pizzas served.

In the analysis, we aim to answer questions like: 
- How many customers do we have each day? Are there any peak hours?
- How many pizzas are typically in an order? Do we have any bestsellers?
- How much money did we make this year? Can we indentify any seasonality in the sales?
- Are there any pizzas we should take of the menu, or any promotions we could leverage?

The goal is to identify opportunities for improvement, like potentially adjusting the menu by removing certain pizzas or introducing promotions that can enhance sales. The insights gained from this analysis will help make informed decisions to optimize the pizza shop's operations and offerings.
